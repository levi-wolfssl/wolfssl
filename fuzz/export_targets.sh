# We'll need absolute paths, because we'll be cd'ing around a bunch
### NOTE ######################################################################
# The below is a bit funny, I know, but it's the most robust and portable way
# that I know of to get absolute paths. Basically, if cd fails for some reason,
# the expansion will come up empty. Otherwise, the absolute path will always
# end with a slash, which is needed because otherwise if for some insane reason
# the last directory in $PWD ends with new line characters ('\n'), then the
# command substitution would strip them off. I then strip the trailing slash so
# that I can later use the variable in a natural fashion.
#
# Note that I insist on removing any slash from the end of $PWD. In all, it
# prevents doubling up on slashes, and it seems that a slash is forbidden from
# being part of a file name due to how the linux kernal itself handles file
# paths. As such, taking a single trailing slash off the end should never be a
# problem.
